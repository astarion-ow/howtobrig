        <h2>The Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>Brig is a hero centered around balance. There are times when Brig's best play is to engage on enemies close-range, swinging and bashing as aggressively as possible. There are times when Brig's best play is to stay far away from the enemy team and poke them with her Whipshot when possible. Neither course of action should be your sole playstyle for the duration of any given game, rather you should observe the state of the game and determine which is the greater benefit for your team in the given moment. A Brig who only plays close-range, swinging on any enemy they can find, will inevitably put themselves in a bad position, feed, and die. A Brig who only plays with long-range Whipshots might as well play another Support.</p>
        <p><strong>Brig's greatest asset as a Support is her ability to control and defend space on the map.</strong> Yes, the AOE healing from Inspire is great. Yes, the burst healing from her Repair Packs is great. Yes, Rally is a versatile and powerful Ultimate. None of these individual abilities are what make Brig so strong in virtually any team, they are all in service to her ability to <strong>control and defend space.</strong> So, what does this mean?</p>
        
        <h3>Controlling Space</h3>
        <h4>Setting Up</h4>
        <figure class="float-right"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/3m186l.webp#right" alt="Dorado Example" width="480px" height="270px"><figcaption>Dorado 1st Point</figcaption></figure><p>Once you are in a strong position, you want to remain in/around that position for as long as you can without dying or until the game state has changed such that your position is no longer as strong as it was. As an example, on an Escort map such as Dorado, playing on the high ground highlighted in green is where you will often want to start when playing Defense. However, even if the enemy team is playing dive and you are repeatedly successful in keeping them off of this space, the nature of Escort means that the payload's progress will alter the game state even if it is far away from reaching the next checkpoint. On Dorado, the payload will eventually reach the choke of the archway, at which point you will often want to give up your position outlined in green to move closer to the area highlighted in blue. Through no fault of your own, the green space is now inherently less advantageous to control than the blue space and you must adapt accordingly. Furthermore, just because the green space has grown weaker, that does not mean that it won't return to being the stronger position later on in the match. If you move to the blue position and your team subsequently wins the fight and holds the choke, then you will likely want to set up for the next fight by returning to the green position. This concept of moving between areas of the map based on their immediate advantages and disadvantages is called rotation and is a key part of playing Overwatch as a whole. As Brig, you will want to identify areas that give you strong line-of-sight to where you anticipate the next fight will occur, and/or areas that would be advantageous for the enemy team to control, and rotate to and from those areas accordingly.</p>

        <h4>Dropping From High Ground</h4>
        <p>Outside of certain techs that let her abuse map geometry with Shield Bash, Brig has no vertical mobility whatsoever. When electing to drop from high ground to swing on the enemy team, keep in mind how difficult it will be for you to return to that high ground. Some high grounds, such as the tall buildings on the second point of Hollywood, are easy for Brig to access due to the elevators. Other high grounds, like the buildings overlooking the first point of King's Row, will take significantly longer for Brig to get to and may also put Brig in view of the enemy team, allowing them to kill you while rotating. If you are not confident that you can return to the high ground before the start of the next team fight, then reconsider dropping down.</p>

        <h4>Not Feeding</h4>
        <p>The advice any Support player will most often hear is to "play their life." Due to how powerful the Support role is, losing a Support early on can snowball into a lost team fight so not dying becomes central to the role's ethos. HOWEVER, the biggest mistake a Brig player can make with this advice is to play too passively. A Brig who focuses on "playing her life" will not seize opportunities to make game-winning plays for fear of dying. This is why I would not recommend prioritizing "playing your life" to aspiring Brig players. This does not mean that you should be cavalier about your deaths and start shield bashing directly into a full HP Reinhardt. This means not taking fights you KNOW you cannot win. When the enemy team sends their tank and two DPS after you, do not stay and fight as we both know you will lose and die. When there is a Ashe in your range who already used her Coach Gun, then go to her and kill her.</p>

        <h4>Tilting</h4>
        <p>Everyone in Overwatch gets tilted at some point. Maybe the enemy Hanzo just keeps hitting bullshit headshots, maybe your team is filing into the enemy's bullets conga line style and never regrouping, maybe there's another Pharmercy that your DPS cant seem to shoot. While it is normal to get tilted by these frustrating situations, the worst thing you can do as Brig is to get tilted into focusing a single enemy or believing you must solo carry the team to victory. If you get tilted by an enemy Hanzo, do not get tunnel vision and start running at the Hanzo in a blind rage as soon as you see him because no one on your team seems to be able to kill him. You will play worse, you will put yourself in a bad position, you will die, you will lose, and you will get even more tilted. By playing intelligently, you can turn around losing games. By letting the frustration dictate your playstyle, you will go on loss streaks.</p>
        <p>I have a personal rule to log off for the day if I lose three games in a row, but you can come up with your own means of dealing with the urge to tilt-queue. Also, we all know that Overwatch comms can be toxic and that can be detrimental to the learning experience. Disabling these altogether can be good if you are the type of person who is easily upset.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For voice chat, you can disable auto-joining your teams voice channel in <strong>Options→Sound→Voice Chat→Team Voice Chat: Off.</strong></li>
            <li>For text chat, you can quickly hide the text chat UI by pressing <strong>Ctrl+Shift+C</strong>, or you can disable joining text chat altogether in <strong>Options→Social→Team Text Chat: Off.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Downtime</h4>
        <p>Don't be afraid of downtime. There will be moments during your matches when you are functionally doing nothing other than standing around. An impatient Brig player who uses this time to get more involved in a fight will die more often and die early, potentially losing your team a round or even the game. Sometimes, standing menacingly is the most valuable thing a Brig can do.</p>
        <p>In the below example on Watchpoint: Gibraltar, you can see that I am essentially standing still in spawn for a solid 20 seconds at the start of the game . Since my team is taking opening spam damage, my job is just to sit back and toss packs until my Tank and DPS manage to get through to set up their own engagements.</p>

        <h3>Using Your Kit</h3>
        <p>As I'm sure you are aware, Brig has three primary aspects to her kit:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Her Shield</li>
            <li>Her Repair Packs</li>
            <li>Her Whipshot</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before we discuss these parts of her kit in-depth, let's address a few things regarding her basic flail swing. First and foremost, you should always be swinging. If you are not playing in Masters+ lobbies then you should either be swinging or holding your shield up for the entire game, even if you are miles away from the enemy team. It's a good habit to get into, even if you don't see its value in every single match. You will occasionally clip enemy heroes who wander into your proximity or even spycheck a Sombra by doing this, which may seem like meager benefits, but the alternative is getting zero benefits at all. There is no reason to not swing your flail all the time, so swing your flail all the time.</p>
        <figure class="float-right"><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/ao87hw.webp" alt="Brig Ability Configuration" width="364px" height="304px"></figure>
        <p>Of note, Brig does not have a melee attack like most other heroes, instead her primary fire and her melee are functionally the same button, with both causing her to swing her flail when pressed. Crucially, however, while these inputs both do the same thing, they are still separate inputs. What I'm getting at here is a basic quality of life change I'd recommend you make. Brig's Shield Bash is triggered by pressing primary fire when her shield is up, meaning you are pressing M1 (left mouseclick) while holding M2 (right mouseclick). When you are in the heat of the battle, you will be pressing these two buttons constantly, and I am certain you have, at least a few times, made the mistake of Bashing when you didn't intend to because of this. If you have a mouse with additional buttons near your thumb then I would recommend remapping your controls on Brig so that melee is bound to M1 and primary fire is bound to M4 (M4/M5 are the two keys by the thumb on my mouse, though your mouse may differ slightly). Shield Bash only triggers when using primary fire, not when using melee, so you will never accidentally Bash again since your Bash is now tied to M4 and you can swing your flail as normal using M1 without worry.</p>
        <h4>Shield Management</h4>
        <h5>Using the Third-Person Camera</h5>
        <p>Brig is part of a very limited roster of characters who can freely switch to a third-person perspective midgame. The third-person camera is incredibly important to Brig's kit, as it allows you to scout around corners and see threats you otherwise would not be able to see. </p>

        <h5>Shielding Teammates</h5>
        <p>Because Brig's shield is so flimsy and her only movement ability is directly tied to it not being broken, you have to be selective about using it to protect teammates. There are two primary scenarios in which I will deliberately stand in front of a teammate with my shield.</p>
        <p>The first is when I am on maps with long sightlines such as Havana and am playing alongside characters like Ana, Ashe, or Widowmaker. At the start of the round, you can stand in front of those teammates to allow them to safely get early damage in and prevent them from being killed by a stray Widowmaker shot or Hanzo projectile. Since you yourself are far away from the action at this stage, you can sit in front of your teammate until your shield breaks, duck behind cover as soon as its broken, and then come back out to shield again once your shield has regenerated. You can loop this one or two times before you'll have to actually start playing the game properly. Try not to move too much while you are doing this, since your character model will obscure your teammate's view and they will move on their own to accommodate you standing in front of them.</p>
        <p>The other scenario in which you should shield off your teammate is when the enemy Ana manages to land a Sleep Dart on one of your squishier teammates. Whenever this happens, if I am close enough then I will Bash on over and sit over their body with my shield up to prevent incoming damage or, more importantly, to block a follow-up Anti-Nade.</p>
        <p>Any other applications of this technique you'll have to just play by ear. For example, though I would rarely consider shielding my Tank considering their large HP pools and defensive capabilities, there are times when your Tank will attempt to rotate out of heavy fire and just barely mistime their movement. In these scenarios, your shield could be the difference between them dying or making it to cover alive. You can also use shield to protect allies using stationary abilities, such as Mercy's Resurrection or Cassidy's Deadeye. Again, play it by ear.</p>
